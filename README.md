# Similar-words-searcher-by-Word2Vec
## It's a similar words searcher by Word2Vec model made with tensorflow

### 用TensorFlow做的一个基于Word2Vec模型的一个词语训练、储存、读取和近似特征词搜寻的python code。

### It's a python code that allow trainning text, saving/read model and use it for searching approximate characteristic words, which based on Word2Vec model, and made by TensorFlow.

It's hyper parameter is:

When it runs, it shows some words randomly, and show them all along the trainning.

Then, after it trained, we can turn on the TO_JUDGE switch and search.

By the way, we can also get a picture about the words' distribution projected to 2 dim world.
